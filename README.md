This project analyze the usage of K-nearest neighbors and Convolutional Neural Network model in Image Classification.

- The first part of the project analyzes the usage of K-nearest neighbors and Convolutional Neural Network model in Image Classification for Fashion MNIST dataset and CIFAR_10 dataset. The analysis is reported in the pdf file "Using different models in Images Classification.pdf".

- The second part of the project focuses on experimenting different methods to improve CNN model for CIFAR_10 dataset. The analysis is reported in the pdf file "Improve Convolutional Neural Network model for CIFAR_10.pdf".
