This project analyzes the usage of K-nearest neighbors and Convolutional Neural Network model in Image Classification.

- The first part of the project analyzes the K-nearest neighbors model and the second part of the project analyzes the Convolutional Neural Network models in the Images classification task.
- The project uses the Fashion MNIST and CIFAR_10 datasets for classification tasks to analyze and compare two models.
